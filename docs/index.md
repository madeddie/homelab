## Welcome to my homelab

This repository has all I need to maintain my homelab, this includes hardware and
services I run for my own benefit as well as experimentation with software I use
or plan to use professionally.

For now check the repo [README](https://github.com/madeddie/homelab/blob/main/README.md)
for more information.
